Out of the 11 glioma patients, 14 meningioma patients, and 11 healthy controls that were included pre-surgically, 7 glioma patients (1 drop-out, 1 no resection, 2 end of study), 12 meningioma patients (1 drop-out, 1 MRI not possible because of cochlear implant), and 10 healthy controls (1 drop-out) agreed to participate post-operatively. 

Of all subjects the following data were acquired:
- T1w MPRAGE anatomical scan (anat)
- resting-state fMRI (func)
- multi-shell HARDI diffusion-weighted MRI (dwi, acq=AP)
- short DWI with reverse phase encoding directions (dwi, acq=PA)
- cognitive assessment using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): MOT, RVP, RTI, SSP & SOC
- questionnaires assessing demographic information, lifestyle habits & emotional functioning
