Brain Tumor Connectomics Data

TVB derivatives

Pre-operative data of 11 glioma patients, 14 meningioma patients and 11 control subjects that were used in paper "Modeling brain dynamics in brain tumor patients using The Virtual Brain". 
Post-operative data of 7 glioma patients, 12 meningioma patients (1 [sub-PAT11] with bad data quality) and 10 control subjects. 
Out of the 11 glioma patients, 14 meningioma patients, and 11 healthy controls that were included pre-surgically ("BTC_preop" on OpenNeuro), 7 glioma patients (1 drop-out, 1 no resection, 2 end of study), 12 meningioma patients (1 drop-out, 1 MRI not possible because of cochlear implant), and 10 healthy controls (1 drop-out) agreed to participate post-operatively. 
Compared to the initial database, 6 patients were excluded: 2 because of glioma grade 4, 3 because of subtentorial tumor, 1 because of absence of MRI data (subdural grid).

The raw data are stored as BIDS format in openneuro.org:
10.18112/openneuro.ds001226.v1.0.0, ds001226 for the preoperatory and
10.18112/openneuro.ds002080.v1.0.0, ds002080 for the postoperatory.

The structural connectivity (SC) is derived with the TVB pipeline (https://github.com/BrainModes/TVB-empirical-data-pipeline) with manual segmentation when necessary.

The regions are according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas.
